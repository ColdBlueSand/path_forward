# Key Points For System Design Interview

## Breakdown
The following is a very rough guide on distributing your time in a 45-minute interview session. Please remember this is a rough estimate, and the actual time distribution depends on the scope of the problem and the requirements from the interviewer.
| Step | Description | Estimated Time |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Step 1 | Understand the problem and establish design scope | 3 - 10 minutes |
| Step 2 | Propose high-level design and get buy-in | 10 - 15 minutes |
| Step 3 | Design deep dive | 10 - 25 minutes |
| Step 4 | Wrap | 3 - 5 minutes |

From ChatGPT,

**Step 1: Clarify requirements and constraints (5 minutes):**
Quickly identify the key goals and constraints of the system.
Understand user needs, expected load, and any critical non-functional requirements.

**Step 2: Establish core components and high-level architecture (5 - 10 minutes):** Lay out the system’s main components and how they interact.
Focus on ensuring that all major areas are covered (e.g., frontend, backend, databases, APIs).

**Step 3: Deep dive into key components (10 - 15 minutes):**
Choose one or two critical components (like the database or a core service) to explore in detail.
Discuss design decisions, data flow, and any algorithms or data structures you’ll use.

**Step 4: Discuss scalability, performance, and trade-offs (10 - 15 minutes):**
Address how the system will handle scaling (vertical and horizontal).
Discuss potential performance bottlenecks and how you’ll mitigate them.
Explore trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CAP theorem).

**Step 5: Summarize and address security or edge cases (5 - 10 minutes):**
Recap the main design choices.
Briefly touch on security considerations (authentication, data encryption) and how the system handles edge cases.
Address any follow-up questions from the interviewer.
